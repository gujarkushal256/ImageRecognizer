# ImageRecognizer

In this I have used **_Tensorflow, Numpy and Matplotlib Modules_** to create a simple image recognizer.
It only recognizes images of specific objects given in the list.**_(i.e. ['Plane','Car','Bird','Cat','Deer','Dog','Frog','Horse','Ship','Truck'])_**
It accepts of the above objects in 32 X 32 aspect ratio only. I have used this ratio due limited memory size of the system you can also increase the ratio
by modifying few lines of code.
The size of training data and testing data can also be changed according to your system capability.
This ImageRecognizer model have **_65.35 % Accuracy and 10.30 % Loss_**.
